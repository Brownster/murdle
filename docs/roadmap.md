# Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap outlines tasks for building the multiplayer Wordle app described in `docs/research.md`.

## 1. Setup Repositories and Environment
- Create separate front-end and back-end projects.
- Bootstrap the React client using Create React App.
- Initialize a Node.js server with Express and Socket.IO.
- Configure CORS settings for local development.
- Document Render deployment settings (build command and port).

## 2. Implement Core Game Logic on Server
- Define data structures to track players, rooms and game state.
- Handle Socket.IO connection, disconnection and `joinGame` events.
- Implement `startGame`, `guess` and `gameOver` events.
- Load a word list for choosing the secret word.
- Broadcast updates to all players in the default room.

## 3. Build the Front-End UI and Components
- Connect to the server using `socket.io-client`.
- Create name/avatar entry modal and lobby player list.
- Build the Wordle grid and on-screen keyboard.
- Display guess results with color animations.
- Keep keyboard letter states in sync with guesses.

## 4. Polish the UI and User Experience
- Apply responsive CSS for board and keyboard layout.
- Add tile flip animations and optional sound effects.
- Provide dark‑mode styling and avatar display tweaks.
- Style the leaderboard/results modal.

## 5. Deployment on Render
- Deploy the static front-end and note its URL.
- Deploy the Node back-end as a Web Service.
- Set environment variables such as `REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL`.
- Restrict CORS to the static site URL in production.
- Test the deployed site with multiple clients.

## Future Improvements
- Support multiple rooms with unique codes.
- Add timers or multi‑round tournaments.
- Persist leaderboards or user accounts in a database.
- Offer variant word lengths or additional Wordle modes.
- Enhance polish with shareable results and accessibility options.
