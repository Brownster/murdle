Thanks! I’ll put together a detailed development plan for your multiplayer Wordle-style app with real-time gameplay, avatar/name selection, and lobby-based game starting, all optimized for hosting on Render's static site tier. I’ll outline both frontend and backend architecture, UI considerations, and deployment strategy.

I’ll get back to you shortly with the full plan.


# Multiplayer Wordle Web App – Project Plan

## Overview and Goals

We will build a **fully featured Wordle-style web application** that supports real-time multiplayer gameplay for up to 10 players. All players in a session will attempt to guess **the same secret word** concurrently (just like Wordle, with colored feedback on letters). The app will include a **lobby/room system** (initially a single default room), where users can enter a name and choose an avatar, then play together in real-time. The UI should be **polished and responsive** across devices, providing an experience comparable to popular Wordle clones. We will deploy the front-end as a **static site on Render** (leveraging Render’s free tier features like a global CDN and HTTPS) and implement a lightweight back-end for real-time features (using WebSockets). The plan below outlines the technology stack, key features, architecture, and step-by-step development strategy.

## Tech Stack and Architecture

* **Front-End:** We will use a modern JavaScript framework (e.g. **React** with Create React App or Next.js in static export mode) for building the UI. React is suitable for building an interactive Wordle grid and managing state. Render supports popular frameworks with quickstart guides (e.g. Create React App) for static site deployment. Styling will be done with CSS (consider using a UI library or **Tailwind CSS** for rapid styling). The app must be responsive (mobile-friendly) and visually polished.
* **Back-End:** We will deploy a minimal **Node.js server** (on Render’s free tier Web Service) using **Express** and **Socket.IO** for real-time communication. Socket.IO will enable low-latency, bidirectional WebSocket connections between the server and clients. This server will manage game state (rooms, active word, player progress) and broadcast events (e.g. start game, guess results, game over) to clients in real-time. We choose Node/Socket.IO for ease of implementation of real-time multiplayer features.
* **Data Storage:** For this scale (max 10 players per game), we do **not need a heavy database**. The game state (current word, player scores, etc.) can be kept in-memory on the server. If we want persistence (e.g. list of high scores or user accounts) in the future, we can integrate a small database. For now, all game rounds are ephemeral. We will include a **word list** (possible secret words and maybe allowed guess words) stored on the server or delivered with the front-end. This can be a static list (e.g. a JSON file of valid 5-letter words). The memory and storage footprint for a word list and 10 players’ data is trivial and fits within Render’s free tier limits.
* **Hosting on Render:** The front-end will be deployed as a **Static Site** on Render for free (served via Render’s CDN for fast global loads). The back-end will be a separate **Web Service** on Render (free tier) to handle Socket.IO connections and game logic. We will need to configure CORS or allowed origins so the front-end (on Render’s domain) can communicate with the Socket.IO server domain. Render’s static hosting gives us benefits like instant cache invalidation on deploy, managed SSL, HTTP/2, etc. The web service will also get a free HTTPS URL (with TLS certs auto-managed). Both services can be linked via environment variables (e.g. the front-end can know the WebSocket server URL).

**Room Architecture:** In the initial version, we’ll have a single **default room** that all players join. In future, we’ll support multiple rooms (with ability to create/join rooms from a landing page). We can use Socket.IO’s concept of **rooms** to manage multiple game lobbies – “A room is an arbitrary channel that sockets can join and leave. It can be used to broadcast events to a subset of clients”. This will allow scaling to multiple separate games easily. For now, the server will treat all connected players as one room (the “default” room). We will designate one player as the **host** (e.g. the first player to open the site or the one who clicks “Start Game”) who can initiate the round. When the host clicks “Start Game”, the server will pick a secret word and broadcast the game start to everyone in that room.

## Front-End Design and User Interface

**Layout:** The main game interface will closely mimic the classic Wordle layout for familiarity. At the top, show the game title or room name and perhaps a small lobby status (number of players, etc.). The center of the screen will contain the **Wordle grid** for the current player’s guesses: 6 rows of 5 tiles (assuming 5-letter words and 6 guesses, which is standard). Each tile will be styled to flip and change color (grey for absent, yellow for present, green for correct) after a guess is submitted – we should implement a smooth flip animation for reveal, to make the UI feel polished (like the original Wordle). Below the grid, display a **virtual keyboard** (on-screen keyboard layout) showing letters Q–W–E... and so on in rows, which highlights keys in green/yellow/grey after guesses to help the player keep track of which letters are confirmed or ruled out. This on-screen keyboard is crucial for mobile responsiveness (so players on phones can tap letters instead of using their system keyboard, which can be clunky). It should update letter colors to indicate misplaced and correct letters as feedback. Also allow desktop users to use their physical keyboard for convenience (capture key events for letter input and Enter/Backspace for submit/delete).

**Responsive Design:** Ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes. On mobile screens, the grid and keyboard may need to be scaled down and vertically stacked. We will use CSS flexbox or grid to center the Wordle board and allow it to shrink/grow. The keyboard might need a slightly smaller font on very small screens. Use the meta viewport tag for mobile scaling. The UI should be usable in both portrait and landscape (in landscape, perhaps the keyboard might go beside the grid if width allows). We must test on common device sizes. A **polished UI** means paying attention to spacing, colors, and feedback. We will use Wordle-like color themes (green #6aaa64, yellow #c9b458, grey #787c7e for tiles, etc.) so users immediately recognize the feedback meaning. The background can be a neutral tone (Wordle uses off-black and off-white for dark/light modes – we can implement a dark mode toggle as a nice extra). We should avoid any ugly or default-styled elements – for example, no raw browser alerts for errors; use styled modals or inline messages for any notifications. *(Poorly styled clones have been criticized for lack of polish – e.g., users complained about ugly UI, lack of typing input, and non-responsive layouts, so we will consciously avoid these pitfalls.)*

**Avatar and Name Input:** When a user first opens the site (or at least before joining the game), prompt them to **enter a display name and choose an avatar**. This could be done via a simple form overlay or modal dialog. For example, show a modal "Enter your name and pick an avatar" with a text input for the name and a selection of avatar images. We can provide a set of default avatars (10 or so small cartoon icons, or use an avatar generator API to create unique avatars). Since storage is limited and to keep things simple, we can bundle a few avatar image files with the front-end and let the user pick one (just display them in a grid for selection). The chosen name and avatar will be sent to the server when joining the room, so that other players can see them. We will also display each player’s own name/avatar somewhere on the UI (e.g. at the top or in a corner) for reference. The name could be limited to, say, 10 characters to prevent overflow, and we’ll sanitize it to prevent any HTML injection if it’s displayed on others’ screens.

**Lobby & Player List:** In the pre-game lobby (default state when players join and game hasn’t started), show a **player list** UI. This could be a simple sidebar or overlay listing all players currently connected in the room, with their avatar and name. If we have exactly one default room, this is essentially “who’s online right now”. Mark one of them as the host (for instance, with a star or “(Host)” label next to their name). The host will have a **“Start Game”** button visible. Other players simply wait for the game to start. The UI should update in real-time as new players join or leave: when someone new connects, add them to the list; when someone disconnects (closes the browser), remove them. These events will come via Socket.IO (e.g. a “playerJoined” or “playerLeft” event).

**Game Start and Gameplay UI:** Once the host starts the game, the lobby view transitions to the game view for all players. At this point, each player sees their own Wordle grid (initially all empty). We can hide the full lobby list during gameplay (perhaps minimize it to a small panel showing remaining players or a count, to reduce screen clutter). Each player now independently types guesses into their grid. After each guess submission (on pressing Enter), the guess is sent to the server for validation and scoring. The server responds with the color feedback for that guess (which letters are green, yellow, grey). The front-end will then update that row of tiles with the colors (and animate the reveal). It will also update the on-screen keyboard key colors. This process repeats until the player guesses the word correctly or runs out of guesses. We will allow the standard 6 guesses per player. If a player finds the correct word, we might highlight their grid or name (e.g. a celebration animation or a trophy icon by their name) to indicate they’ve solved it. We should **not reveal the word immediately** to others when one player solves it – others should continue playing until they either solve or exhaust their guesses (unless we decide the game ends immediately on first solve; this is a game design choice discussed later).

**Leaderboard & Results:** When the round ends (either one player wins or everyone has finished guessing), we display a **leaderboard** or results modal. This will list all players, their avatars, and their performance: typically, the number of guesses they took to solve, or “DNF/✖” if they failed to solve. We will sort this list by who won or who did better. For example, the player who solved in the fewest guesses (or if tie, who solved faster) is ranked #1. If we are treating it as a competition “first to get it wins,” then the winner is the one who got it first (we can record a timestamp on correct guess to determine order). The leaderboard can just be for that round (since we are not doing a multi-round tournament yet in the first version). We’ll include some playful text like “🏆 Winner: Alice (solved in 4 guesses)” and list others like “Bob – solved in 5, Carol – not solved”. This screen should also have a **“Play Again”** or “Next Round” button. In the initial version, we can allow the *host* (or perhaps any player) to trigger starting a new round, which simply resets everyone’s game state and picks a new random word to start another game with the same group. (In future, if we implement persistent scoring across rounds, we’d accumulate points here, but for now each round is standalone.) If we plan to extend to multiple rooms later, the UI landing page would allow creating a new room or joining an existing one by code – but as noted, initially everyone just falls into the default room for simplicity.

**Polish and Extras:** To make the UI extra polished, consider adding small details: for example, animate the tiles flipping when revealing colors (like original Wordle), shake the row if an invalid word is entered (and perhaps show a toast “Not in word list”), and a subtle pop animation when letters are typed into a tile. We should also provide feedback for certain actions: e.g., if the host clicks “Start Game” before at least one other player is in, perhaps disable the button or show “Waiting for players”. If we fetch definitions of the word after reveal (an optional feature), we could show “The word was X, meaning: …” after a round, but this can be a stretch goal. The main focus is a **smooth, bug-free user experience** that feels like a real Wordle game, just multiplayer.

## Back-End Gameplay Logic and Real-Time Communication

The Node/Express server will handle several responsibilities: **managing connections**, **game state (rooms & words)**, **processing guesses**, and **broadcasting updates**.

**Socket.IO Real-Time Events:** We will use Socket.IO to listen for and emit events between clients and server. Key events and their purpose:

* `connection`: Triggered when a new player connects. We’ll add them to the default game room. We’ll maintain a list of players (with their socket id, name, avatar) on the server. We then broadcast an update to all other players like “player X joined” (including their name/avatar) so the UI can update the lobby list. Similarly, handle `disconnect` to remove players and notify others.

* `startGame`: Emitted by the host when they click “Start Game”. When the server receives this, it will check that a game isn’t already in progress, then generate or select a secret word for this round. The word will be a random 5-letter word from our word list (ensuring it’s likely common enough to guess). The server will store this secret word in memory (e.g., `currentWord` for that room). It will then emit a `gameStarted` event to all players in the room, containing perhaps the length of the word and maybe any game settings (for now just the standard settings). All clients on receiving `gameStarted` will transition their UI from lobby to the game screen. (We might also designate who is the “host” in the data, though not critical once game is running.)

* `guess`: Emitted by a client when they submit a guess (with the guess word as data). The server receives a guess from a specific player. **Word validation**: the server should first validate that the guess is a real word (we’ll have an allowed word list for guesses – the original Wordle has a list of \~10k allowed words). We can either store that list on the server or also in the client for instant validation. To prevent cheating and keep authoritative logic on server, it’s good to do server-side check too. If the word is not in the list, the server can emit a `invalidGuess` event back to that player (or we could just emit a generic “error” that triggers a shake animation + message). If valid, the server then computes the **letter feedback**: compare the guess to the secret word letter by letter to determine green/yellow/grey. (This logic will mimic Wordle’s scoring: for each letter in guess, mark green if exact match; for non-greens, mark yellow if the letter appears elsewhere in the secret word and how many times accounting for already matched letters, etc.). We then emit a `guessResult` event **to that specific player** with the feedback for that guess (e.g., an array of {letter, color} for the 5 letters). The client will use this to render tile colors.

* Optionally, we might **broadcast some info about guesses** to others. For fairness, we won’t reveal the actual letters of another player’s guess to everyone (that could give away the answer indirectly). However, we might broadcast a high-level update like “Player X has made guess #3” or “Player Y solved the word!” to update the opponent status. For example, we could emit `playerProgress` events to everyone whenever a player submits a guess, containing that player’s ID and maybe their guess count or a boolean if they solved it. This can be used to update a small indicator on the UI (like a list showing “Alice: 3 guesses used” etc.). If we want to show more, one approach used in some clones is to show others’ guesses only after you’ve solved the word yourself – but to keep things simple initially, we will likely not display others’ guess grids in real-time (avoiding information leakage). We will just show an indicator or nothing until the end.

* `solved`: Instead of a separate event, we can determine a solve when a `guessResult` is all green letters. When the server detects the guess matches the secret word, it means that player has solved the puzzle. The server can mark that player as solved in its state (and maybe note the guess count and timestamp). It can then emit to everyone a `playerSolved` event announcing that player X has solved (without revealing the word yet). The clients could use this to e.g. put a checkmark or trophy by that player’s name in the UI. If we choose to end the game immediately when someone solves (winner takes all), we would at that point emit a `gameOver` to everyone and reveal the word. However, a better approach to keep all players engaged is to let everyone continue until they either solve or run out of attempts, especially since the others might still want to get it right even if they know someone already won. Perhaps we can do: as soon as one solves, start a **timer** (say 30 seconds or so) to give others a chance to finish up, then end the round. But this might not be necessary with only 10 players; it could just naturally conclude when last person finishes guessing. We will implement a simple rule: *the round ends when all players have either guessed the word or used all their attempts*. At that point, or after a short delay when the last guess is done, the server emits `gameOver` with the final results (the secret word and each player’s outcome).

* `gameOver`: Emitted by server to all when the round is complete. It will include data like the secret word, and a list of players with their number of guesses or “fail” status. All clients receive this and then display the leaderboard/results modal as described in the UI section. We’ll reveal the secret word on this screen (“The word was: \_\_\_\_\_”).

**Game State Management:** On the server side, we will maintain a data structure for the game state of the room. For example:

```js
gameState = {
    word: "APPLE", 
    players: {
       [socketId1]: { name: "Alice", avatar: "avatar1.png", guesses: 0, solved: false },
       [socketId2]: { name: "Bob", avatar: "avatar2.png", guesses: 0, solved: false },
       ...
    },
    started: false
}
```

When `startGame` happens, we populate `gameState.word` and mark `started=true`. We might also store the list of allowed guess words in memory for validation. As guesses come in, we increment that player’s guess count and check if solved. We’ll also need to limit guesses to 6 per player: if a player tries to guess after 6, server can ignore or send an event that they’ve exhausted attempts. (Also, if the player disconnects, we might treat them as out of the game.) All this state can be reset when a new game round starts. Because we only have up to 10 players and one room initially, this is straightforward to manage in memory. Should we later allow multiple concurrent rooms/games, we’d make `gameState` a map by room, and isolate state per room. Each socket joins a room (via `socket.join(roomName)` in Socket.IO) so we can do `io.to(roomName).emit(...)` to send events to just that game.

**Leader/HOST logic:** We assume the first player to access the site becomes the host (in future, the one who creates a room is host). We’ll store a flag like `gameState.hostId = socketId1`. Only that socket will be allowed to trigger `startGame`. If the host disconnects before starting, we should assign a new host (e.g. the next in line). We can simply choose the earliest joiner as the new host and inform that user (perhaps via an event like `hostUpdate`). This ensures someone can start the game. If host disconnects mid-game, it might not matter since game already started. If we needed a host to trigger next round, we can again assign one as needed.

**Security and Cheating Considerations:** The secret word must remain secret! Since our front-end is a static bundle, we will **not send the secret word to the client** (until game over). The server will only send colored feedback. This prevents a user from inspecting network or global variables to find the solution. We should also validate on the server that a player isn’t making guesses after game over or making more than allowed guesses, etc., just to keep the game logic consistent for all. Using Socket.IO rooms inherently prevents players from getting events from other games they’re not in, and vice versa. We might also implement basic rate limiting (e.g. one guess per player every few seconds) to avoid someone spamming guesses rapidly (though 6 guess limit naturally caps it; also if we ever had a global chat or something, we’d consider rate limiting). For now, focus is on game function.

**Word Selection:** We need a source of words. We can incorporate the original Wordle word list (there are public lists available). Typically Wordle has two lists: one of possible *solution words* (\~2300 common 5-letter words) and a broader list of allowed guesses (\~10k). To keep it simple, we could use the solution list for both picking the secret and validating guesses (it means only fairly common words can be guessed, which players might find acceptable; or include a larger list for validation if we like). We’ll include these word lists either in the backend code or in a separate file. On `startGame`, choose a random word from the solutions list that day (or truly random every game – since we want unlimited play, not one per day, we’ll do random each game). We should ensure the same word isn’t immediately repeated if multiple rounds are played – maybe remove it from list or just random with memory of last word. But with 2300 words, repeat chance is low.

**Scoring and Future Expansion:** In the initial version, scoring is simply who wins that round. If later implementing multiple rounds in one session, we could give points (e.g. winner gets 3 points, second place 2, etc., or based on guess counts) and keep a running score across rounds, showing a cumulative leaderboard. The Product Hunt description of WordleCup shows they allow host to set number of rounds and so on. We’re not doing that now, but we are laying the groundwork (multiple rounds by manually hitting play again). Adding a persistent score would be a small addition later (just carry a score field in player state).

## Development Steps

Below is a step-by-step plan for the developer to implement this project:

### 1. Setup Repositories and Environment

* **Repo structure:** Create two repositories (or two folders in a monorepo) – one for the front-end and one for the back-end. This separation fits deploying a static site and a Node service on Render. For example, `wordle-multiplayer-client` and `wordle-multiplayer-server`.

* **Front-end initialization:** Use Create React App (`npx create-react-app`) or an equivalent tool to bootstrap the React app. This gives a working build pipeline. Verify that `npm run build` produces static files. Alternatively, use Next.js with `npm create-next-app` if familiar (just ensure to output a static build, or if using any SSR/Node features, note that would need a different deployment approach). Another option is Vue or Svelte if preferred, but React is assumed for now due to familiarity.

* **Back-end initialization:** Set up a Node.js project (`npm init`) for the server. Install Express and Socket.IO (`npm install express socket.io`). Also, install any needed CORS middleware (`cors` package) or configure Socket.IO’s cors options to accept the front-end origin. Create an `index.js` or `server.js` that will hold the server code. Use `express()` to create an app and an HTTP server (`const server = require('http').createServer(app)`) then attach Socket.IO (`const io = require('socket.io')(server, { /* options */ })`). We’ll listen on some port (say 3000 for dev).

* **Render config:** In each repo, add a README or documentation for deployment. For the static site, after development, we’ll connect it to Render by linking the GitHub repo and specifying the build command (`npm run build`) and publish directory (`build/` for CRA). For the server, we’ll deploy it as a web service, specifying `npm start` (with a start script in package.json) and the port. On Render, the free web service will expose a port via the environment variable `PORT`, so ensure the server uses `process.env.PORT || 3000`. Also, we might need to enable “Always on” if we want to avoid cold starts (though free tier might not support always-on, but that’s okay).

* **Testing setup:** During development, you can test locally by running the server on `localhost:3000` and the React dev server on `localhost:3001` (CRA default 3000, so maybe swap to avoid conflict, or vice versa). Make sure to allow CORS so the dev front-end can talk to dev back-end. On Socket.IO server, something like:

  ```js
  io = new Server(server, {
    cors: { origin: "http://localhost:3000" }
  });
  ```

  and on client use `io("http://localhost:3000")` when connecting. Keep an `.env` or config to switch the Socket.IO URL to production when deployed (e.g. `REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL` pointing to the Render service URL). No database or other services are needed, simplifying dev setup.

### 2. Implement Core Game Logic on Server

Start by coding the core logic on the back-end without the full front-end, using simple tests or dummy clients if necessary:

* Define data structures for player info and game state.
* Implement event handlers for **connection** and **disconnection**: when `io.on('connection', socket => { ... })`, handle storing the new player. Initially, you might just assign them a generic name or ID until we hook up the front-end sending actual names. But eventually, you’ll handle a handshake where the client immediately emits something like `joinGame` with their chosen name & avatar. So implement a handler for `joinGame` that takes name/avatar, adds to `players` list, and does `socket.join('default')`. Broadcast to others that a new player joined (maybe emit `playerList` or `playerJoined`).
* Implement `startGame` event handler: only proceed if game not already started. Choose a random word from list. (Load the word list from a file at startup or have it hardcoded in an array). Set game state (the word, reset each player’s guess count=0 and solved=false). Then emit `gameStarted` to the room. You might include in that event data like the word length, and maybe an empty state of players.
* Implement `guess` handler: as described, validate the guess word and compute the result. For computing letter feedback, write a helper function (this can be tested independently). Ensure it correctly marks letters (careful with duplicates: e.g., secret "APPLE", guess "ALLEY" – the second L in guess should be grey because secret has only one L which was already matched by first L guess being yellow/green, etc.). After computing result, if guess is correct, mark player solved and note their guess count and perhaps the timestamp (e.g. `player.solved = true; player.finishTime = Date.now()`). Emit `guessResult` back to the guessing socket with the colors. If correct, additionally emit `playerSolved` to everyone with that player’s name. Check if this guess ended the game: if all players either solved or out of guesses (or if we decide immediate end on solve), then emit `gameOver`.
* Implement `gameOver` logic: gather results of all players. Determine the rankings or at least the winner. Compose a results object (like `[{name: Alice, guesses:4, solved:true}, {name: Bob, guesses:6, solved:false}, ...]` sorted appropriately). Include the secret word. Emit `gameOver` to the room with that data. Mark game as not started (allow a new round).

All these events will make use of Socket.IO to emit to either specific socket (`socket.emit`) or broadcast (`io.to(room).emit` for room-wide). Socket.IO automatically handles sending to all in a room if we use `io.to('default').emit(...)`.

**Testing server logic:** Use unit tests or temporary code to simulate a sequence: e.g., simulate two players connecting, one starting game, then one guessing correctly, etc., and log the outputs. Alternatively, run the React front-end later to test it live. But having the server logic solid will make front-end integration smoother.

### 3. Build the Front-End UI and Components

Now focus on the React app:

* **Layout and State Management:** We can use React’s functional components and hooks. Consider a top-level component `App` that holds the high-level state: whether we are in lobby or in game, the list of players, and maybe the current user’s status. We might use a state management library if needed (but probably can do with Context or simple prop passing for a small app). We know we need to reflect real-time updates, which will come via Socket.IO events. So we will integrate Socket.IO client in the front-end. We can use the official `socket.io-client` library (`npm install socket.io-client`). In an effect hook, connect to the server: `const socket = io(SOCKET_SERVER_URL)`. Listen for events: e.g., `socket.on('gameStarted', ...), socket.on('guessResult', ...), etc.`. We’ll update React state accordingly when events arrive.

* **Name/Avatar Input:** Create a component or modal for entering name & avatar. This might be shown conditionally (e.g., if the user hasn’t set a name yet, or on first load). Once the user submits it, we store it in state (and possibly localStorage so that if they come back to the site later, we can remember their name/avatar). Immediately emit a `joinGame` event to the server with this data so the server knows who this socket is. The server can then include this info in the global player list. The UI can then show the lobby with that name.

* **Lobby Component:** Create a `Lobby` component that takes the list of players from state and renders them (e.g., an `<ul>` of names with avatar images). If `isHost` (we’ll determine if this client is host by comparing their socket ID to a hostId provided by server in `playerList` event or similar), then show a **Start Game button**. Hook the button to emit `startGame` via the socket. Also possibly disable it if fewer than 1 other players are present (optional).

* **Game Board Component:** Once in game, render a `GameBoard` component. This will manage the guess grid and keyboard. We need state for the current guess input (as the user types letters, they fill one row until Enter). We also need to store past guesses and their results to render the grid. One way: keep an array of guesses, where each guess is an object like `{ word: 'CRANE', result: ['gray','yellow','green','gray','gray'] }`. Each time a guessResult comes from server, we find the corresponding guess and attach the result. Actually, since the server only sends result after we submit, we can optimistically add the guess to an array of guesses when we send it, but mark it pending until result arrives. Or simpler: handle input in a controlled way: maintain `currentGuess` string and on Enter, if length == 5, emit `guess` event and then reset currentGuess (and perhaps push it into a `submittedGuesses` list). The server’s response will give colors which we then map to that guess in state. This ensures the grid re-renders with colored tiles.

* **Rendering the grid:** Make a 6-row, 5-column grid. We can map over an array of 6 indices for rows. For each row index, determine the letters and colors: if row index is less than `submittedGuesses.length`, that row is a past guess – show its letters and corresponding colors. If it equals `submittedGuesses.length` (the next empty row) and game not over, that’s the current guess being typed – show its letters that have been input (and blank for remaining cells). If greater, show all empty cells. Style each cell: e.g., a base square with border. Apply background color class based on the color in the guess result (green/yellow/gray). We’ll add CSS for flip animations: possibly add a class like “flip” that triggers a CSS animation when the result is set. (We can trigger this by adding a slight delay for each cell reveal after receiving result – Wordle flips letters one by one with 0.3s delay each. We can mimic that by using a setTimeout for each index to add a class.)

* **Keyboard component:** Render a visual keyboard. We can define an array of rows: `[['Q','W','E',...], ['A','S','D',...], ['Z','X','C',...]]` to map out keys. Render each as a button or div. Attach onClick that, if game is active and the row not filled, adds that letter to `currentGuess` state. Also listen for actual keyboard events: attach an event listener on `keydown` (perhaps in a useEffect on GameBoard mount) to capture letters and Enter/Backspace. On desktop, this allows typing. On mobile, tapping the on-screen keys does the same. The keyboard keys also need to display feedback colors. We maintain a mapping of letter -> status (unused, gray, yellow, or green). Initially all letters are “unused”. When we get a guessResult, for each letter, we update its status in that map – e.g., if result says letter ‘A’ is green, mark that. If a letter is already green from a previous guess, it stays green (don’t override it with a later yellow). If a letter is yellow and later we get green for it, upgrade to green, etc. Then the keyboard re-renders coloring the keys accordingly. This way, the player sees which letters they have confirmed or eliminated, improving usability.

* **Receiving events and updating UI:** Use Socket.IO client in a React context or a service module. For instance, create a custom hook `useSocket` that handles connecting and returns the socket instance, plus perhaps some state for global events. Or simply manage socket in App component and pass it down via context. On `playerJoined` event, update the player list state (add the new player). On `playerLeft`, remove from list. On `playerList` (if the server sends the whole list at once initially), set it. On `gameStarted`, perhaps reset relevant state: clear `submittedGuesses`, reset keyboard letter statuses, set `gameActive=true`, and maybe store an indicator that game is in progress. On `guessResult` (specific to this client), find the last guess in `submittedGuesses` and attach the colors, or use it to update the grid state accordingly. On `playerSolved`, mark that player as solved in the player list state (so we can maybe display a checkmark next to their name in a sidebar or header). On `gameOver`, display the results: you might store the results in a state variable `gameResult` and set `gameActive=false`. When `gameResult` is non-null, render the leaderboard overlay. The leaderboard component can map over the results and highlight the current user perhaps. Include a button "New Game". If the user is host (we’ll know via state), clicking New Game emits `startGame` again to start the next round. If not host, maybe the button is disabled or hidden and they wait for host. (Alternatively, allow anyone to start next round – up to game design. Possibly only host to avoid confusion.)

* **Visual feedback and edge cases:** If the server sends `invalidGuess` (word not in list), show a message or shake animation on the current row. If a user tries to press Enter with less than 5 letters typed, ignore or flash the row. If tries after 6th guess (shouldn’t have the UI allow that anyway), ignore. If the game is over (maybe someone already won and we decided to immediately stop accepting guesses), the server might broadcast a `gameOver` and the front-end should then not allow further input (we can disable the input or have a check `if !gameActive then ignore key presses`).

At this point, once front-end and back-end are both implemented, **open multiple browser windows** (or use a friend) to test the full flow:

* Two or more players join (enter names/avatars) – verify everyone sees each other in the lobby list.
* Start game – verify all clients transition to game view.
* Each player make some guesses – verify they get correct feedback on their own screen. Also possibly watch one player’s screen while another guesses to see if any intended cross-update happens (like maybe an indicator of opponent progress). If we implemented `playerSolved` event, see that when one finishes, the other sees an update (like “Alice solved it!”).
* Complete the game – either someone wins or all guesses done – verify the gameOver/leaderboard shows on all, with correct info (word reveal, winner, etc.).
* Test edge cases: all players fail to guess (should still end game and reveal word), one player disconnects mid-game (server should handle it – perhaps treat them as out, and if they were host, assign new host), late joiner (if someone joins while a game is in progress, perhaps we either prevent it or allow them to observe? For simplicity, we might prevent joining mid-round – could implement by server checking `if game started then either reject join or add them as spectator`). We can decide to lock room when game in progress, or just let them join but not participate until next round. A simple approach: if `gameState.started` is true when someone new connects, the server can send them a message like “Game in progress, please wait” and not include them in the current round’s logic. For now, it’s fine if we say “join before game start”.

### 4. Polish the UI and User Experience

With basic functionality working, refine the UI for polish and responsiveness:

* Add CSS styling: ensure the grid is perfectly aligned and the tiles are uniform size. Perhaps use CSS Grid for the 5x6 layout. The keyboard layout can be a simple flex container for each row, centering the keys. Use media queries or flex-wrap to adjust the keyboard on smaller screens (maybe keys a bit smaller).
* Add the animations for tile reveal. Possibly add sound effects (Wordle has subtle sound on key press and win, though not essential).
* Ensure the avatar images display nicely (maybe as 40x40px circles next to names). If using external avatar generator, ensure it loads properly.
* Add a toggle for dark mode (not required, but “polished” could include that). At least ensure the color contrast is good for different screens (some clones also have a colorblind mode, but that might be overkill now).
* Check that all interactive elements have appropriate cursor changes, touch areas (for mobile, make buttons large enough).
* The leaderboard modal: style it well (maybe a translucent dark background overlay with a centered card). List player rows with medal emoji for top player, etc., to celebrate.
* If time permits, create a simple **landing page** even if we have default room. E.g., show game title and a “Join Game” button that then opens the name/avatar modal. This could later become the place to choose creating a new room or joining, so structuring it now might help, but optional.

Throughout this, continually test on different devices or use responsive dev tools. Pay attention to performance (our app is lightweight, so performance should be fine; at most optimize the animations if any jank).

### 5. Deployment on Render

Finally, deploy both parts to Render:

* **Deploy Static Front-End:** Go to Render Dashboard, click **New > Static Site**. Connect the GitHub repo (ensure the code is pushed). Configure as follows: set the build command (`npm run build` if CRA or appropriate build for Next/Vite), and the publish directory (e.g. `build` or `.next/static` if Next static export, etc.). Then click “Create Static Site”. Render will build and deploy it. Once deployed, note the URL (it will be something like `yourapp.onrender.com` unless a custom domain is set). The static site is served via Render’s CDN which means users around the world will load the front-end quickly with HTTPS and other performance benefits by default (Brotli compression, HTTP/2, etc. are automatic). If you have environment-specific variables (like the Socket.IO server URL), configure them: e.g., in Render’s dashboard for the static site, add an environment variable for `REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL` pointing to the backend’s URL, and ensure the build picks it up. Since static sites are just files, often you bake the backend URL into the code or config. Alternatively, use relative paths if the front-end can be served from the same domain – but since we separate, we’ll use the full Render URL of the backend.

* **Deploy Back-End:** Click **New > Web Service** on Render. Connect the server repo. Set environment: choose Node, and specify the start command (like `node index.js` or if using something like `npm start`). Set the Node version if needed via a render.yaml or environment variable (optional, default is fine). Most importantly, the free tier has limited resources, but our app is not heavy (few users, light logic) so it should run easily within, say, 512 MB RAM. When deployed, Render will give it a URL like `yourapp-server.onrender.com`. Socket.IO will use **WebSocket** transport which should work on Render (Render supports WebSockets on its services). We should double-check any configuration needed (likely none special; just ensure we use the correct port). The server will likely be accessible on HTTPS as well. The front-end should connect to `wss://yourapp-server.onrender.com` (Socket.IO does this under the hood when given the https URL).

* **Configure CORS/Allowed Origins:** By default, our Socket.IO server might reject requests from an origin not set. We used the cors option in development. In production, set it to the actual static site’s URL. For example:

  ```js
  io = new Server(server, {
      cors: { origin: "https://yourapp.onrender.com" }
  });
  ```

  Alternatively, if both front-end and back-end are on the same domain (if we had one service), CORS isn’t an issue, but here they are different subdomains onrender.com. So do configure it. We can also allow all origins for simplicity during testing, then restrict later if desired.

* **Environment Variables:** If using any secrets or keys (not really in this project aside from word list file), ensure to set them in Render. For instance, if the word list is large, we might store it in an external file or require some API – but we have it locally, so no external API keys needed. Perhaps just ensure `NODE_ENV=production` for optimization on Node, etc.

* **Testing on production:** After deploying, open the static site URL, try connecting multiple clients (you can open the URL in multiple browser windows or share with a friend). Verify that everything works end-to-end in the deployed environment. Pay attention to any console errors (CORS issues, etc.) and fix accordingly (for example, if socket connection fails, might be due to needing `https://` in the URL or a missing config). Render provides logs for the backend service, so watch those for any runtime errors.

* **Bandwidth/limits:** The app should comfortably run within free tier limits. Static sites have generous bandwidth (100 GB/month free) which is plenty for our assets (the biggest assets might be avatar images or JS bundle, which are small). The WebSocket messages are tiny text, negligible bandwidth. If the app becomes unexpectedly popular (hundreds of players), we might hit the concurrent connection limit or need to scale up, but for up to 10 players as intended, we’re fine. Render’s DDoS protection and global CDN add reliability, though we still should handle what happens if the server restarts (game state would reset; not critical for friendly games, but just note that a dyno sleeping or restarting will lose current game – acceptable trade-off on free tier).

## Future Improvements

While the above plan achieves the core functionality, here are a few enhancements we might consider once the basic version is running:

* **Multiple Rooms:** Allow users to create private rooms with a unique code or link, and public matchmaking. This would involve extending the lobby UI to either create a room (generate a room ID, maybe allow setting custom word length or rounds) or join by entering a code. The backend would manage multiple room states (using Socket.IO rooms as noted). WordleCup, for example, lets players join random public rooms or create private ones. We can emulate that flow.
* **Rounds and Timers:** Implement a multi-round tournament mode, or a **timer** for each round. For instance, a mode where players race against a clock – e.g., 60 seconds to solve, or like Squabble’s approach where correct guesses add time and you eliminate others by being faster. Our architecture with server controlling logic can accommodate adding a countdown timer broadcast to clients (Socket.IO can emit a tick or clients can count down locally after sync). For now, we keep it untimed except possibly a gentle nudge.
* **Persistent Leaderboards/User Accounts:** We could allow players to see cumulative stats (like how many games won, fastest solve, etc.). This would require a database to save user records by some identifier. It’s beyond the immediate scope but a possible extension.
* **Word length variants or other Wordle variants:** Could allow games with 6-letter words, etc., as an option when starting a room. The logic would generalize (just change grid size and word lists).
* **UI polish:** Add features like sharing results (like Wordle’s share emoji grid), sound effects, confetti animation on win, etc., to make it more fun. Also ensure accessibility (aria labels on keyboard, etc., so screen reader users or colorblind mode with high contrast symbols).

By following this plan, a developer should be able to implement the multiplayer Wordle web app with a clean, responsive interface and smooth real-time gameplay. The combination of a static front-end on Render’s CDN and a lightweight Node/Socket.IO backend will result in a fast and free-to-host solution, perfectly suited for up to 10 friends competing in Wordle.
